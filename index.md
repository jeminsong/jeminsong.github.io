## CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 01 Part-1
  This lab marked the beginning of my journey. Its simpleness motivated me to always read the instructions. Additionally, I learned how to code for the first time by printing.

* Lab 02 Part-2
  This lab was a blast! I transformed my childhood game into a computer vesrion, mastering message printing and storing.

* Lab 07 Part-2
  This was my favorite lab, because I learned how to play blackjack and code the game. I managed to master if statements and variable declaration.

* Lab 08 Part-1
  This became my favorite lab as well. I managed to master arguments and somewhat understand if statements. Thus, by doing this lab I managed to create myself a sandwich and savor it, all through newfound knowledge. Additionally, I mastered how to use strings.
